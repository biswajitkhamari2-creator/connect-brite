const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "What does ClaimForSure do?",
    a: "We help policyholders in India file new insurance claims and recover delayed or rejected claims across health, motor, life, property, and travel insurance — with expert review, document preparation, insurer follow-ups, and (where needed) ombudsman or legal escalation.",
  },
  {
    q: "My health insurance claim was rejected. Can you still help?",
    a: "Yes. Most rejections can be appealed if filed within the insurer's grievance window. Send us the rejection letter and policy copy — we'll audit the reason, draft a representation, and pursue the insurer's grievance cell, IRDAI Bima Bharosa, or the Insurance Ombudsman as appropriate.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much do you charge?",
    a: "We charge a transparent service fee disclosed upfront before you sign. There are no hidden percentages on your claim amount and no charge to evaluate your case.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does claim recovery take?",
    a: "Insurer-level escalations typically resolve in 15–45 days. Ombudsman cases take 3–6 months. Court-stage matters take longer. We share realistic timelines after the initial review.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which insurers do you work with?",
    a: "All IRDAI-licensed insurers in India, including Star Health, HDFC ERGO, ICICI Lombard, Bajaj Allianz, Niva Bupa, Care, Tata AIG, New India Assurance, LIC, Max Life, and more.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data safe?",
    a: "Yes. All documents are stored privately, shared only with claim handlers assigned to your case, and never sold. See our Privacy Policy for full details.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you have a physical office?",
    a: "We operate primarily over phone, email, and WhatsApp so you don't have to travel. For in-person consultation in Odisha, contact us to schedule.",
  },
