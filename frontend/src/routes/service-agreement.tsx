          <p>This Service Agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is made and executed on the date of acceptance by the Client through the ClaimForSure platform, between <strong>CLAIMFORSURE</strong> (&ldquo;Service Provider&rdquo;), an insurance claim assistance firm based in the State of Odisha, India, and the <strong>user/customer</strong> who registers on the platform and clicks &ldquo;I Accept&rdquo;.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">1. Scope of Services</h2>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>Review of policy documents, claim circumstances and supporting evidence.</li>
            <li>Drafting, filing and submission of the claim with the insurer.</li>
            <li>Follow-up with insurer, surveyor, hospital, TPA or ombudsman on behalf of the Client.</li>
            <li>Expert review, additional documentation and escalation up to resolution.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">2. Processing Fee</h2>
          <p>Upon approval of the claim for active processing, the Client shall pay a non-refundable processing fee of <strong>INR 1,770/-</strong> (inclusive of GST) through the in-app Razorpay gateway.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">3. Success Fee — 20% + GST</h2>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>Service Provider is entitled to <strong>20% of the gross amount</strong> sanctioned, approved, settled or paid by the insurer to the Client, <strong>plus GST</strong> at the prevailing rate (currently 18%) on the Success Fee.</li>
            <li>Becomes due immediately upon insurer&rsquo;s approval/sanction/settlement, or credit into the Client&rsquo;s bank account, whichever is earlier.</li>
            <li>Client must declare the payout (with documentary proof) through the in-app &ldquo;Declare Payout&rdquo; form <strong>within 48 hours</strong> of receipt.</li>
            <li>Invoice issued by Company is payable <strong>within 7 days</strong>; failure flags the Client as a Defaulter.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">4. Anti-Evasion</h2>
          <p>The Client undertakes not to conceal, under-declare or misrepresent any claim proceeds, not to submit fabricated proof, not to re-route insurer payment to third parties, and not to accept the claim outside the platform to avoid the Success Fee. Any such act constitutes <strong>fraud, criminal breach of trust and cheating</strong> under Sections 318 &amp; 316 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (formerly IPC 420 / 406), entitling the Company to civil and criminal remedies.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">5. Interest &amp; Recovery Costs</h2>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
            <li>Late payment carries interest at <strong>18% p.a.</strong> calculated daily from the date of insurer payout.</li>
            <li>Client shall reimburse all advocate, court, arbitration and incidental costs incurred in recovery.</li>
            <li>Overdue accounts may be reported to credit bureaus and the Company&rsquo;s Defaulter Registry.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">6. Data &amp; Electronic Acceptance</h2>
          <p>Acceptance is recorded along with user ID, email, mobile, IP address, device, timestamp and agreement version. Under <strong>Section 10A of the Information Technology Act, 2000</strong> this electronic acceptance has the same legal effect as a signed paper copy and is admissible in any court of law in India.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">7. Termination Survival</h2>
          <p>If the claim was already submitted or substantially worked upon by the Company and is later approved/paid within <strong>24 months</strong>, the Success Fee obligation survives termination.</p>

          <h2 className="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-[oklch(0.85_0.14_80)]">8. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
          <p>Governed by the laws of India. Courts at <strong>Bhubaneswar, Odisha</strong> have exclusive jurisdiction. Disputes shall first be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with seat and venue at Bhubaneswar, Odisha.</p>
