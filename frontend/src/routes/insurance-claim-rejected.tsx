const REASONS = [
  { title: "Non-disclosure of pre-existing disease", body: "Insurers often reject health claims citing undisclosed medical history at the time of policy purchase. A rejection on this ground is contestable if the condition was unrelated or the claim falls outside the moratorium period under IRDAI rules." },
  { title: "Delay in intimation", body: "Motor and health policies require the insurer to be informed within a stated window. Delay alone is not always a valid ground for rejection — case law recognises reasonable cause." },
  { title: "Policy exclusion cited", body: "Insurers frequently rely on fine-print exclusions. Many exclusions have been narrowed by IRDAI's standard health-insurance product norms and by consumer forum orders." },
  { title: "Documentation shortfall", body: "Missing discharge summary, FIR, indoor case papers, or original bills. Most of these can be reconstructed and re-submitted with a proper representation." },
  { title: "Waiting period / sub-limit", body: "Rejections invoking waiting periods, room-rent capping, or disease-wise sub-limits should be checked against the exact policy wording — insurers sometimes apply the wrong clause." },
  { title: "Suicide, intoxication or fraud clause (life/motor)", body: "Repudiation on these grounds requires the insurer to prove the exclusion. If proof is thin, the claim can be reopened through the ombudsman or consumer forum." },
];

const STEPS = [
  { n: "01", title: "Get the rejection letter in writing", body: "Ask the insurer for a written repudiation letter that quotes the exact clause used. Verbal or SMS rejections are not sufficient for appeal." },
  { n: "02", title: "File an internal grievance", body: "Every insurer has a Grievance Redressal Officer. IRDAI requires a written response within 14 days. Keep the acknowledgement." },
  { n: "03", title: "Escalate to the Insurance Ombudsman", body: "If the insurer does not resolve within 30 days, you can file a free complaint with the Insurance Ombudsman for claims up to ₹50 lakh (per IRDAI's Insurance Ombudsman Rules, 2017 as amended)." },
  { n: "04", title: "Consumer Forum / Civil Court", body: "For amounts above the ombudsman limit or when the ombudsman order is not acceptable, a District / State Consumer Commission complaint is the next step." },
];

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "Can a rejected insurance claim be reopened?",
    a: "Yes. A written repudiation is not final. You can file a representation with the insurer's grievance cell, and if unresolved within 30 days, approach the Insurance Ombudsman. Many rejected health and motor claims are settled at the ombudsman stage.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long do I have to challenge a rejection?",
    a: "You have up to 1 year from the insurer's final rejection letter to approach the Insurance Ombudsman (Rule 14 of the Insurance Ombudsman Rules, 2017). Consumer Commission complaints have a 2-year limitation from the date of the cause of action.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Insurance Ombudsman free?",
    a: "Yes. Filing with the Insurance Ombudsman is free of cost for the policyholder. No lawyer is required, though many people prefer expert representation while drafting the complaint.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents do I need to appeal?",
    a: "The written rejection letter, your policy document, the original claim form, all medical / accident / loss documents already submitted, and proof of premium payment. Any correspondence with the insurer's TPA or surveyor is also important.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle claims outside Odisha?",
    a: "Yes. ClaimForSure works pan-India. All communication with insurers and the ombudsman can be done remotely once we have your documents.",

          A written rejection is not the final word. Under IRDAI rules, every policyholder has a structured
          right to appeal — through the insurer's grievance cell, the Insurance Ombudsman, and Consumer
          Commissions. This guide walks through the real reasons claims get denied and the exact steps to
          reopen one.
